## 🎉 Fun Folder 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Folder**! 🎈 This folder is all about having some fun with KQL (Kusto Query Language)! Not everything in life is about work — sometimes we need to take a break, get creative, and add a bit of humor to the mix. 😄

In this folder, you'll find playful KQL queries like:
- Counting alerts with quirky **stress levels** 🚨☕
- Creating fun **ASCII art** 🎨
- And much more...

KQL doesn't always have to be serious — sometimes it's fun to experiment and bring a smile to your face while exploring data. 😎 So go ahead, explore, tweak, and create your own fun queries! 🎉✨

Remember, work hard, but don't forget to have fun along the way! 💻🌟
